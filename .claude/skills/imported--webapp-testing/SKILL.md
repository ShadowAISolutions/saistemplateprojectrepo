# Web Application Testing

*Imported from [anthropics/skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) — Anthropic's official skills repository.*

Test web applications by writing native Python Playwright scripts.

## Decision Tree: Choosing Your Approach

```
User task → Is it static HTML?
    ├─ Yes → Read HTML file directly to identify selectors
    │         ├─ Success → Write Playwright script using selectors
    │         └─ Fails/Incomplete → Treat as dynamic (below)
    │
    └─ No (dynamic webapp) → Is the server already running?
        ├─ No → Start a local server first, then proceed
        │
        └─ Yes → Reconnaissance-then-action:
            1. Navigate and wait for networkidle
            2. Take screenshot or inspect DOM
            3. Identify selectors from rendered state
            4. Execute actions with discovered selectors
```

## Testing GitHub Pages (This Repo)

For this repo, pages are deployed at `https://ShadowAISolutions.github.io/saistemplateprojectrepo/`. To test:

```python
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

with sync_playwright() as p:
    browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=True)
    page = browser.new_page()
    page.goto('https://ShadowAISolutions.github.io/saistemplateprojectrepo/')
    page.wait_for_load_state('networkidle')

    # Verify the version indicator pill appears
    version_pill = page.locator('[id*="version"]')

    # Take a screenshot for visual verification
    page.screenshot(path='/tmp/page-test.png', full_page=True)

    browser.close()
```

## Reconnaissance-Then-Action Pattern

1. **Inspect rendered DOM**:
   ```python
   page.screenshot(path='/tmp/inspect.png', full_page=True)
   content = page.content()
   page.locator('button').all()
   ```

2. **Identify selectors** from inspection results

3. **Execute actions** using discovered selectors

## Common Pitfall

- **Don't** inspect the DOM before waiting for `networkidle` on dynamic apps
- **Do** wait for `page.wait_for_load_state('networkidle')` before inspection

## Best Practices

- Use `sync_playwright()` for synchronous scripts
- Always close the browser when done
- Use descriptive selectors: `text=`, `role=`, CSS selectors, or IDs
- Add appropriate waits: `page.wait_for_selector()` or `page.wait_for_timeout()`
- Install Playwright if needed: `pip install playwright && python -m playwright install chromium`
