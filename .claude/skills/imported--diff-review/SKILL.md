# Differential Review

*Inspired by [Trail of Bits differential-review skill](https://github.com/trailofbits/skills) — adapted for pre-push code review.*

Security-focused review of all changes between a base reference and HEAD.

## Usage

```
/diff-review              # Review changes since origin/main
/diff-review HEAD~3       # Review last 3 commits
/diff-review v02.05r      # Review changes since a specific version
```

## Review Process

### 1. Gather the Diff

```bash
# Default: changes since origin/main
git diff origin/main..HEAD

# File list with stats
git diff origin/main..HEAD --stat

# Commit log
git log origin/main..HEAD --oneline
```

### 2. Security Review

For each changed file, check:

- **Secrets & credentials** — new API keys, tokens, passwords, `.env` values accidentally committed
- **Injection vectors** — new `innerHTML`, `eval()`, `document.write()`, unsanitized template literals
- **Authentication/authorization** — changes to access control logic, permission checks
- **Data exposure** — sensitive data logged, returned in error messages, or stored client-side
- **Dependency changes** — new external scripts, CDN resources, or package additions

### 3. Quality Review

- **Regression risk** — does the change break existing functionality?
- **Error handling** — are new error paths handled gracefully?
- **Edge cases** — are boundary conditions covered?
- **Consistency** — does the change follow existing patterns in the codebase?

### 4. Repo-Specific Checks

For this repo specifically:

- **Version files** — if HTML pages were changed, were `html.version.txt` files bumped? (Pre-Commit #2)
- **GAS sync** — if `.config.json` was changed, were synced files updated? (Pre-Commit #15)
- **CHANGELOG** — do all user-facing changes have entries? (Pre-Commit #7)
- **Private repo compat** — no `raw.githubusercontent.com` or `api.github.com` in client-side code? (Pre-Commit #19)
- **Developer branding** — do new files have `Developed by:` footer? (Pre-Commit #10)
- **Structure tree** — if files were added/removed, were REPO-ARCHITECTURE.md and README.md tree updated? (Pre-Commit #6, #8)

## Output Format

```
## Differential Review: <base-ref>..HEAD

### Stats
- N files changed, N insertions, N deletions
- N commits

### Security Findings
[SEVERITY] Finding description (file:line)

### Quality Findings
[NOTE] Finding description (file:line)

### Repo Checklist
✅ Version files bumped
✅ CHANGELOG updated
⚠️ Missing developer branding in new-file.js
❌ Private repo compatibility violation in page.html:42

### Verdict
PASS / PASS WITH NOTES / FAIL (with reasons)
