# Known Constraints & Fixes

Two categories of hard-won knowledge:
- **Constraints** — architectural rules that **must not be changed**. Every constraint has broken production when violated.
- **Fixes** — bugs that were found, diagnosed, and resolved. Documents what went wrong, why, and what fixed it — so future sessions don't re-introduce the same problems.

> **For Claude Code sessions:** Before proposing security fixes, refactoring, or "improvements" to any code covered here, **read this file first**. If your proposed change conflicts with a constraint, the change is wrong — not the constraint. If your proposed change touches code that was fixed below, understand the fix before modifying it.

---

## Constraint A — postMessage `'*'` targetOrigin (HTML → GAS)

**Rule:** When the HTML page sends a `postMessage` to the GAS iframe (e.g. `exchange-token`), the `targetOrigin` parameter **must be `'*'`**. Do NOT replace it with `GAS_ORIGIN`, `'https://script.google.com'`, or any specific origin.

**Why:** Google Apps Script uses a double-iframe sandbox architecture:
1. The `<iframe>` element's `src` points to `script.google.com/macros/s/.../exec`
2. That URL serves a shell page that creates an **inner** iframe at a `*.googleusercontent.com` subdomain
3. The actual GAS-served HTML (your listener code) runs inside the inner sandbox frame

The sandbox origin (`*.googleusercontent.com`) is dynamically generated and unpredictable. Setting `targetOrigin` to `'https://script.google.com'` causes the browser to silently drop the message because the recipient's actual origin is `googleusercontent.com`, not `script.google.com`.

**Exposure is limited:** The `_pendingToken` is nulled immediately after sending (single-use), and `<meta name="referrer" content="no-referrer">` prevents token leakage via HTTP headers.

**Times this was accidentally changed:** 3+ (each time it broke sign-in silently with no error messages)

**Affected code:**
- `testauth1.html` — `exchange-token` postMessage in the `gas-ready-for-token` handler

---

## Constraint B — `event.source` for HTML → GAS sandbox replies

**Rule:** When replying to a message from the GAS sandbox (e.g. replying to `gas-ready-for-token` with `exchange-token`), use `event.source.postMessage(...)` — **not** `gasApp.contentWindow.postMessage(...)`.

**Why:** Due to the double-iframe architecture (Constraint A), `gasApp.contentWindow` references the **outer** `script.google.com` shell frame — not the **inner** sandbox frame where the listener runs. Messages sent to `gasApp.contentWindow` are dispatched on the shell's window and never reach the sandbox's `window.addEventListener('message', ...)`.

`event.source` is the `WindowProxy` of the frame that sent the original message. When the sandbox sends `gas-ready-for-token`, `event.source` points directly to the sandbox frame. Replying via `event.source` delivers the message to the correct listener.

**Affected code:**
- `testauth1.html` — `gas-ready-for-token` handler must use `event.source` to send `exchange-token`

---

## Constraint C — GAS deploy webhook must stay unauthenticated

**Rule:** The `doPost(e)` handler's `action === 'deploy'` path must **not** require session authentication. It is called by the GitHub Actions workflow (via `curl`) to trigger GAS self-update after a push to `main`.

**Why:** The workflow runs in CI — it has a `GITHUB_TOKEN` but no GAS session token. Adding session requirements to the deploy path breaks the auto-deploy pipeline.

**Affected code:**
- `testauth1.gs` — `doPost(e)` deploy handler

---

## Constraint D — Google Sign-In flow cannot be short-circuited

**Rule:** The complete sign-in chain must execute in order: Google OAuth popup → token callback → token exchange (URL or postMessage) → GAS session creation → `gas-session-created` message → HTML saves session + loads app. No step can be skipped or reordered.

**Why:** Each step depends on the output of the previous step. The Google access token is single-use for session creation. The GAS session token is generated server-side and must be delivered back to the HTML page before the app iframe can load authenticated content.

**Affected code:**
- `testauth1.html` — `initGoogleSignIn()` → `handleTokenResponse()` → `exchangeToken()` → message listener
- `testauth1.gs` — `doGet(e)` token exchange paths → `exchangeTokenForSession()`

---

## Constraint E — GAS → HTML messages use `PARENT_ORIGIN` (not `'*'`)

**Rule:** When GAS sends messages to the HTML page (via `window.top.postMessage`), it **must** use `PARENT_ORIGIN` (the GitHub Pages origin) as the `targetOrigin`. This direction is secure because `window.top` is always the known HTML page.

**Why:** Unlike Constraint A (HTML → GAS), the GAS → HTML direction has a known, stable target origin. Using `'*'` here would unnecessarily expose messages to any parent frame. `PARENT_ORIGIN` is derived from `EMBED_PAGE_URL` and is a fixed, predictable value.

**Note:** This is the **opposite** of Constraint A. The asymmetry exists because GAS knows where the HTML page lives (GitHub Pages — stable origin), but the HTML page cannot know where the GAS sandbox lives (googleusercontent.com — dynamic origin).

**Affected code:**
- `testauth1.gs` — all `window.top.postMessage(...)` calls in generated HTML

# Resolved Fixes

Bugs that were diagnosed and fixed during development. Each entry documents the symptom, root cause, and fix — preventing future sessions from unknowingly re-introducing the same issue.

---

## Fix 1 — postMessage exchange not reaching GAS sandbox (sign-in stuck)

**Version:** v01.50w (testauth1.html) · v03.18r

**Symptom:** After switching to the `hipaa` auth preset (which uses `TOKEN_EXCHANGE_METHOD: 'postMessage'`), sign-in got stuck on the "Sign In Required" page. Google OAuth completed successfully but the token exchange never happened — no errors in console.

**Root cause:** The `exchange-token` postMessage was being sent via `gasApp.contentWindow.postMessage(...)`. Due to the GAS double-iframe architecture (see Constraint A), `gasApp.contentWindow` is the **outer** `script.google.com` shell frame — the actual listener runs in the **inner** `googleusercontent.com` sandbox frame. The message was dispatched on the wrong window.

**Fix:** Changed to `event.source.postMessage(...)` in the `gas-ready-for-token` handler. `event.source` is the `WindowProxy` of the frame that sent the message, so it targets the sandbox directly. This also became **Constraint B**.

**Affected code:**
- `testauth1.html` — `gas-ready-for-token` handler

---

## Fix 2 — HMAC verification rejecting all sessions (blank page after sign-in)

**Version:** v01.23g (testauth1.gs) · v03.19r

**Symptom:** After Fix 1 resolved the sign-in flow, the page was no longer stuck on the login screen — but the GAS app content was blank. No elements displayed after successful sign-in.

**Root cause:** The `hipaa` preset enables `ENABLE_HMAC_INTEGRITY: true`, which signs sessions with an HMAC. However, the `HMAC_SECRET` GAS script property was never configured (it requires manual setup in GAS project settings). When the secret is missing:
1. `generateSessionHmac()` returns `''` (empty string)
2. The session is stored with `hmac: ''`
3. `verifySessionHmac()` checks `if (!sessionData.hmac) return false` — since `!''` is truthy, **ALL sessions are rejected**

The asymmetry between generation (returns empty = "no HMAC") and verification (rejects empty = "HMAC failed") caused every authenticated session to be treated as invalid.

**Fix:** Added a secret-existence check to `verifySessionHmac()`: if the `HMAC_SECRET` property doesn't exist in script properties, return `true` (pass through). This makes verification match generation — both treat missing secret as "HMAC not available" rather than "HMAC failed."

**Affected code:**
- `testauth1.gs` — `verifySessionHmac()` function

---

## Fix 3 — Re-sign-in after sign-out stuck (stale HMAC message key)

**Version:** v01.51w (testauth1.html) · v03.20r

**Symptom:** Fresh sign-in worked correctly. But after signing out and attempting to sign in again (without refreshing the page), the sign-in got stuck on the "Sign In Required" page — identical to Fix 1's symptom. A full page refresh fixed it.

**Root cause:** When `ENABLE_HMAC_INTEGRITY` is active, the `gas-session-created` message delivers a per-session `_messageKey` used to verify subsequent GAS→HTML messages. The HMAC verification layer checks:
```javascript
if (_messageKey && data.type !== 'gas-session-created' && data.type !== 'gas-needs-auth') {
    if (!_verifyMessageSignature(data, _messageKey)) return; // Silently drop
}
```
On sign-out, `clearSession()` removed the session data from storage but **did not clear `_messageKey`**. When the user signed in again, the GAS iframe reloaded and sent a fresh `gas-ready-for-token` message — but this message is **unsigned** (it's a bootstrap message from a new session). With `_messageKey` still set from the old session, the HMAC layer silently dropped it.

**Fix:** Added `_messageKey = null;` to `clearSession()`. This ensures the HMAC verification layer is reset between sessions, allowing unsigned bootstrap messages from new sign-in attempts to pass through.

**Affected code:**
- `testauth1.html` — `clearSession()` function

---

## Adding New Entries

**Constraints:** When a debugging session reveals an architectural limitation:
1. Add a new constraint section with: Rule, Why, Times violated (if known), Affected code
2. Reference this file in code comments near the constrained code
3. The constraint letter (A, B, C, ...) is permanent — do not renumber

**Fixes:** When a bug is diagnosed and resolved:
1. Add a new fix section with: Version, Symptom, Root cause, Fix, Affected code
2. The fix number (1, 2, 3, ...) is permanent — do not renumber
