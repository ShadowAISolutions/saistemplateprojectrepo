# HIPAA Security Rule — Compliance Reference

A complete breakdown of the HIPAA Security Rule (45 CFR Part 164, Subpart C) for reference when building HIPAA-compliant features. This document covers every standard and implementation specification across all five sections of the Security Rule.

**Important distinctions:**
- **Required** = Must be implemented. No exceptions.
- **Addressable** = Must be implemented OR you must document why it's not reasonable/appropriate in your environment AND implement an equivalent alternative. **Addressable does NOT mean optional.**
- **Standard (no specs)** = The standard itself is required; there are no separate implementation specifications — the standard must be met as a whole.

## Our Project's Implementation Status

This section maps the HIPAA Security Rule requirements to what our project's HIPAA preset (`testauth1.gs` and `testauth1.html`) currently implements. Only the Technical Safeguards (§164.312) are within scope of our code — Administrative, Physical, Organizational, and Documentation safeguards are organizational responsibilities that cannot be enforced through application code.

### Technical Safeguards (§164.312) — What Our Code Controls

| Requirement | Status | Our Implementation | Preset Setting |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Unique User Identification** (Required) | **Implemented** | Google OAuth provides unique email identity per user | Google OAuth + session token |
| **Emergency Access Procedure** (Required) | **Implemented** | Emergency access bypass for designated email addresses | `ENABLE_EMERGENCY_ACCESS: true` |
| **Automatic Logoff — Inactivity** (Addressable) | **Implemented** | Heartbeat-based: session expires on server when user stops interacting (heartbeat stops extending). Auto sign-out on expiry | `ENABLE_HEARTBEAT` + auto sign-out on timer expiry |
| **Automatic Logoff — Absolute** | **Implemented** | Hard 16-hour session ceiling that cannot be extended by heartbeats. Auto sign-out on expiry | `ABSOLUTE_SESSION_TIMEOUT: 57600` |
| **Encryption at Rest** (Addressable) | **Partial** | GAS CacheService is server-side on Google infrastructure; we don't control the encryption layer directly | Google-managed |
| **Encryption in Transit** (Addressable) | **Implemented** | HTTPS enforced by both GitHub Pages and Google Apps Script | Platform-enforced |
| **Audit Controls** (Required) | **Implemented** | Audit log writes login, logout, session events to spreadsheet | `ENABLE_AUDIT_LOG: true` |
| **ePHI Integrity** (Addressable) | **Implemented** | HMAC integrity verification on session data | `ENABLE_HMAC_INTEGRITY: true` |
| **Person/Entity Authentication** (Required) | **Implemented** | Google OAuth verifies identity; session token authenticates subsequent requests | OAuth + session management |
| **Transmission Integrity** (Addressable) | **Implemented** | HTTPS provides integrity checking; HMAC verifies session data wasn't tampered with | Platform + HMAC |
| **Transmission Encryption** (Addressable) | **Implemented** | All communication over HTTPS (TLS) | Platform-enforced |

### Administrative / Physical / Organizational — Outside Our Code's Scope

These requirements must be handled by the organization deploying the application:

| Category | Key Requirements | Our Project's Role |
|---|---|---|
| **Risk Analysis & Management** | Conduct risk assessment, implement risk mitigation | Not applicable — organizational policy |
| **Assigned Security Officer** | Designate a person responsible for security | Not applicable — organizational role |
| **Workforce Security** | Access authorization, clearance, termination procedures | Not applicable — HR/organizational process |
| **Security Training** | Train all workforce members on security policies | Not applicable — training program |
| **Incident Response** | Policies for detecting and responding to security incidents | Partially supported — audit log provides incident data |
| **Contingency Planning** | Data backup, disaster recovery, emergency mode | Not applicable — infrastructure/ops |
| **Business Associate Contracts** | Written agreements with any entity handling ePHI | Not applicable — legal/contract |
| **Facility & Workstation Security** | Physical access controls, workstation policies | Not applicable — physical environment |
| **Device & Media Controls** | Disposal, re-use, accountability of hardware/media | Not applicable — physical asset management |
| **Documentation** | Maintain policies for 6 years, keep them available and updated | Not applicable — document management |

## 2025 Proposed Rule Change

In January 2025, HHS published a [Notice of Proposed Rulemaking](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/01/06/2024-30983/hipaa-security-rule-to-strengthen-the-cybersecurity-of-electronic-protected-health-information) that would:

1. **Eliminate the "Addressable" vs. "Required" distinction** — making ALL implementation specifications mandatory
2. **Require encryption** of ePHI at rest and in transit (currently addressable)
3. **Require multi-factor authentication** in certain contexts
4. **Require annual compliance audits** instead of periodic evaluations

**Status:** Proposed, not finalized. Comments were due March 7, 2025. If adopted, all 22 currently "Addressable" specifications would become "Required", significantly increasing the compliance baseline.

## Key Takeaways

1. **HIPAA specifies no timeout values** — "automatic logoff after a predetermined time of inactivity" is the only guidance. No minutes, no hours. Organizations determine appropriate values through risk analysis
2. **Automatic logoff is Addressable, not Required** — you must implement it or document a justified alternative
3. **Absolute session timeout is not a HIPAA requirement** — it's an OWASP/security best practice. We include it as defense-in-depth
4. **The commonly cited "15 minutes"** is an industry convention (adopted by CMS internally), not a legal mandate
5. **Most of HIPAA is organizational, not technical** — only 7 of the 42 implementation specifications are things our code can directly enforce. The other 35 are policies, procedures, training, physical security, and contracts
