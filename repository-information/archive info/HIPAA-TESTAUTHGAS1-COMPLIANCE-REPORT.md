## 1. Authentication & Access Control (Items #1-9)

### #1 — Unique User Identification ✅ Implemented

**CFR:** §164.312(a)(2)(i) — **Required**

| Aspect | Evidence | File:Line |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| Unique ID per user | Google OAuth email used as unique identifier | `testauthgas1.gs:594` — `email: userInfo.email` |
| No shared accounts | Each session tied to individual email | `testauthgas1.gs:593-603` — session data includes email, displayName |
| Tracking per action | Session token linked to email for all operations | `testauthgas1.gs:618` — audit log includes user email |

**Finding:** Fully compliant. Google OAuth enforces unique identity. Session tokens are per-user, per-device. Audit logs track which user performed each action.

---

### #2 — Person/Entity Authentication ✅ Implemented

**CFR:** §164.312(d) — **Required**

| Aspect | Evidence | File:Line |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| Identity verification | Google OAuth validates access token against Google's userinfo endpoint | `testauthgas1.gs:847-871` — `validateGoogleToken()` |
| Token exchange | OAuth token exchanged for server-side session token | `testauthgas1.gs:482-629` — `exchangeTokenForSession()` |
| Ongoing verification | Session validated on every heartbeat and data operation | `testauthgas1.gs:631-695` — `validateSession()` |

**Finding:** Fully compliant. Authentication is delegated to Google's OAuth infrastructure, which provides industry-standard identity verification. The GAS backend independently validates the token against Google's API — it does not trust client assertions.

---

### #3 — Emergency Access Procedure ✅ Implemented

**CFR:** §164.312(a)(2)(ii) — **Required**

| Aspect | Evidence | File:Line |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| Break-glass mechanism | Emergency access emails stored in Script Properties | `testauthgas1.gs:99` — `ENABLE_EMERGENCY_ACCESS: true` |
| Override logic | Emergency emails bypass spreadsheet ACL check | `testauthgas1.gs:921-934` — `checkSpreadsheetAccess()` emergency override |
| Heavy audit logging | Emergency access events logged to audit trail | `testauthgas1.gs:929` — `auditLog('emergency_access', ...)` |
| Data-level tracking | Emergency access flagged on every data operation | `testauthgas1.gs:768` — `isEmergencyAccess` in session data |

**Finding:** Fully compliant. The emergency access mechanism provides a documented "break glass" path with comprehensive audit logging. Emergency access is flagged separately in both session audit logs and data audit logs.

---

### #4 — Automatic Logoff ✅ Implemented

**CFR:** §164.312(a)(2)(iii) — **Addressable**

| Aspect | Evidence | File:Line |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| Inactivity timeout | Rolling session expiration (15min production / 3min test) | `testauthgas1.gs:80-81` — `SESSION_EXPIRATION: 900` (production) |
| Absolute timeout | Hard ceiling on session life regardless of activity (8hr production / 5min test) | `testauthgas1.gs:82-83` — `ABSOLUTE_SESSION_TIMEOUT: 28800` (production) |
| Server-side enforcement | Session destroyed in CacheService on timeout | `testauthgas1.gs:660-677` — timeout checks in `validateSession()` |
| Heartbeat extension | Active users get session extended; inactive users expire | `testauthgas1.gs:1067-1073` — `processHeartbeat()` resets `createdAt` |
| Client-side awareness | Timer display shows remaining session time | `testauthgas1.html:327` — heartbeat timer UI |

**Finding:** Fully compliant. The implementation is actually more robust than required — it has both rolling inactivity timeout AND an absolute session ceiling, plus heartbeat-based activity detection. Currently running with test values (3min/5min); production values commented out (15min/8hr).

**Note:** Test values are currently active (`⚡ TEST VALUE` markers throughout). Before production deployment, uncomment the production values and remove test values.

---

### #5 — Access Authorization ⚠️ Partial

**CFR:** §164.308(a)(4)(ii) — **Addressable**

| Aspect | Evidence | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|
| ACL-based access control | Master ACL spreadsheet with per-page TRUE/FALSE | ✅ `testauthgas1.gs:941-971` |
| Editor/viewer fallback | Spreadsheet sharing-list check | ✅ `testauthgas1.gs:974-992` |
| Domain restriction | Toggle-gated domain allowlist | ✅ `testauthgas1.gs:544-566` |
| **Role-based access** | No role differentiation (admin vs. viewer vs. editor) | ❌ Not implemented |
| **Attribute-based access** | No field-level access based on role | ❌ Not implemented |

**Finding:** Partially compliant. Access is binary (allowed or denied) — there is no concept of roles or permissions within the application. All authorized users have the same level of access. For a full HIPAA deployment, you would need role-based access control (RBAC) to enforce different access levels (e.g., clinician vs. billing vs. admin).

**Gap:** No RBAC. No field-level access filtering. The ACL determines if a user can access the page at all, but once in, there's no differentiation.

---

### #6 — Access Establishment/Modification ✅ Implemented

**CFR:** §164.308(a)(4)(iii) — **Addressable**

| Aspect | Evidence | File:Line |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| Grant access | Add email to ACL spreadsheet or add as editor/viewer | Master ACL spreadsheet + sharing |
| Modify access | Change TRUE/FALSE in ACL per page column | ACL spreadsheet row-based |
| Revoke access | Remove email from ACL or revoke sharing | ACL + sharing removal |
| Documentation | ACL spreadsheet serves as access log | External to code |

**Finding:** Compliant via the ACL spreadsheet mechanism. Access changes are made in the spreadsheet, which provides a modification history (Google Sheets revision history). The code correctly checks the ACL on every login.

---

### #7 — Termination Procedures ✅ Implemented

**CFR:** §164.308(a)(3)(ii)(C) — **Addressable**

| Aspect | Evidence | File:Line |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| Session invalidation | `invalidateAllSessions()` destroys all sessions for a user | `testauthgas1.gs:817-841` |
| Single-session enforcement | `MAX_SESSIONS_PER_USER: 1` — new login kills existing sessions | `testauthgas1.gs:580-583` |
| Cross-device eviction | Tombstone mechanism notifies other devices | `testauthgas1.gs:831-833` — `evicted_` cache keys |
| Credential deactivation | Remove from ACL → next login attempt denied | ACL check on every `exchangeTokenForSession()` |

**Finding:** Compliant. Session invalidation is immediate. The cross-device enforcement ensures that if access is revoked, the evicted session is notified on the next heartbeat. However, revocation requires manual ACL edit — there is no admin UI to terminate a specific user's access in real-time.

---

### #8 — [NPRM] Multi-Factor Authentication 🔮 Not Yet Required

**Status:** Proposed — would become **Required** if NPRM is finalized.

| Aspect | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Something you know | ✅ Google password | |
| Something you have | ⚠️ Google 2FA if enabled on the user's Google account | Depends on user's Google settings |
| Something you are | ❌ Not implemented | No biometric gate in the app |

**Finding:** The testauthgas1 environment delegates authentication to Google OAuth. If the user has Google 2-Step Verification enabled, they effectively have MFA. However, the app does not **require** the user to have 2FA enabled on their Google account — there is no enforcement. If the NPRM is finalized, you would need to either: (a) restrict access to Google Workspace accounts with enforced 2FA, or (b) add an application-level second factor.

---

### #9 — [NPRM] 1-Hour Access Termination 🔮 Not Yet Required

**Status:** Proposed — would become **Required** if NPRM is finalized.

**Finding:** Current implementation supports immediate session invalidation via `invalidateAllSessions()`. If the ACL is updated, the next login attempt is blocked. However, an existing active session could persist until its rolling timeout expires (up to 15 minutes in production). The NPRM would require termination within 60 minutes — the current 15-minute session timeout already satisfies this, but only if the ACL is updated within 45 minutes of the employment end.

---

## 2. Encryption & Transmission Security (Items #10-13)

### #10 — Encryption at Rest ⚠️ Partial

**CFR:** §164.312(a)(2)(iv) — **Addressable**

| Aspect | Status | Evidence |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Session data encryption | ⚠️ **Not encrypted** — stored as plaintext JSON in GAS CacheService | `testauthgas1.gs:611` — `cache.put(... JSON.stringify(sessionData) ...)` |
| Session integrity | ✅ HMAC-SHA256 protects against tampering | `testauthgas1.gs:606-608` — HMAC on session data |
| ePHI at rest (spreadsheet) | ⚠️ **Google-managed encryption** — Google encrypts at rest by default (AES-256) | Google infrastructure |
| Application-level encryption | ❌ No application-layer encryption on stored data | No field-level encryption in code |

**Finding:** Partially compliant. Google encrypts data at rest at the infrastructure level (Google Sheets, GAS CacheService). However, the application does not add its own encryption layer. Session data in CacheService is plaintext JSON (though integrity-protected by HMAC). This is a reasonable position for an Addressable specification — Google's infrastructure encryption covers the requirement, and this should be documented in the risk analysis.

**Gap:** No application-level encryption. If GAS CacheService data were ever exposed (e.g., via a GAS vulnerability), session data including emails would be readable.

---

### #11 — Encryption in Transit ✅ Implemented

**CFR:** §164.312(e)(2)(ii) — **Addressable**

| Aspect | Evidence | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|
| HTTPS for HTML page | GitHub Pages enforces HTTPS | ✅ |
| HTTPS for GAS endpoints | Google Apps Script enforces HTTPS | ✅ |
| Token exchange (postMessage) | Token never transmitted via URL in HIPAA mode | ✅ `testauthgas1.gs:101` — `TOKEN_EXCHANGE_METHOD: 'postMessage'` |
| No plaintext channels | All ePHI transmission over TLS | ✅ |

**Finding:** Fully compliant. All communication channels use HTTPS/TLS. The postMessage-based token exchange (HIPAA mode) eliminates token exposure in URLs and server logs. Google's infrastructure provides TLS 1.2+ for all GAS endpoints.

---

### #12 — Transmission Integrity ✅ Implemented

**CFR:** §164.312(e)(2)(i) — **Addressable**

| Aspect | Evidence | File:Line |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| TLS integrity | HTTPS provides transport-layer integrity | Infrastructure |
| Message-level integrity | HMAC-SHA256 signatures on all postMessage communications | `testauthgas1.gs:453-475` — `signMessage()` |
| Client-side HMAC verification | Web Crypto API verifies HMAC-SHA256 signatures | `testauthgas1.html:1303-1320` — `_verifyHmacSha256()` |
| Non-extractable keys | HMAC key imported as non-extractable via Web Crypto API | `testauthgas1.html:1287-1299` — `_importHmacKey()` |
| First-write-wins key guard | Prevents HMAC key overwrite by attacker | `testauthgas1.html:1286` — `_hmacKeySet` flag |

**Finding:** Fully compliant. The implementation goes beyond the baseline requirement — it provides both transport-layer integrity (TLS) AND application-layer integrity (HMAC-SHA256 message signing). The cryptographic message authentication between GAS iframe and host page prevents tampering even if a man-in-the-middle could somehow inject into the postMessage channel.

---

### #13 — [NPRM] Mandatory Encryption 🔮 Not Yet Required

**Status:** Proposed — would make encryption at rest AND in transit **Required** (no alternatives).

**Finding:** Transit encryption is already fully implemented. At-rest encryption relies on Google's infrastructure-level encryption. If the NPRM is finalized, the current setup may be sufficient (Google's AES-256 at rest qualifies), but application-level encryption of sensitive fields would provide defense-in-depth.

---

## 3. Audit & Logging (Items #14-19)

### #14 — Audit Controls ✅ Implemented

**CFR:** §164.312(b) — **Required**

| Aspect | Evidence | File:Line |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| Session audit log | `SessionAuditLog` sheet records all auth events | `testauthgas1.gs:334-356` — `_writeAuditLogEntry()` |
| Data audit log | `DataAuditLog` sheet records per-operation PHI access | `testauthgas1.gs:364-400` — `dataAuditLog()` |
| Toggle-gated | HIPAA preset enables both: `ENABLE_AUDIT_LOG: true`, `ENABLE_DATA_AUDIT_LOG: true` | `testauthgas1.gs:94,107` |
| Events logged | Login success/failure, session expiry, emergency access, security alerts, data reads/writes | Throughout `testauthgas1.gs` |
| Tamper resistance | Audit log sheet protected with warning-only lock | `testauthgas1.gs:342-344,384-386` |

**Finding:** Fully compliant. The dual-log architecture (session events + data-level events) exceeds the baseline requirement. Every security-relevant action is captured with timestamp, user, result, and details.

**Improvement opportunity:** The warning-only sheet protection is not tamper-proof — a user with editor access could modify the audit log. Consider using a separate spreadsheet with restricted editor access for production.

---

### #15 — Information System Activity Review ✅ Implemented

**CFR:** §164.308(a)(1)(ii)(D) — **Required**

| Aspect | Evidence | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Reviewable audit logs | SessionAuditLog and DataAuditLog in Google Sheets | ✅ — structured, searchable, sortable |
| Access reports | Login success/failure events with timestamps | ✅ |
| Security incident tracking | `security_alert` and `security_event` event types | ✅ |

**Finding:** Compliant. The Google Sheets format makes the logs easily reviewable, filterable, and exportable. The structured format (timestamp, event, user, result, details) supports systematic review.

---

### #16 — Log-in Monitoring ✅ Implemented

**CFR:** §164.308(a)(5)(ii)(C) — **Addressable**

| Aspect | Evidence | File:Line |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| Failed login tracking | `login_failed` events logged with reason | `testauthgas1.gs:496,539,561,573` |
| Rate limiting (standard) | Flat: 5 failures per 5-minute window | `testauthgas1.gs:494-498` |
| Escalating lockout (HIPAA) | Tier 1: 5→5min, Tier 2: 10→30min, Tier 3: 20→6hr | `testauthgas1.gs:500-526` |
| Account lock alerts | `security_alert` logged on Tier 3 lockout | `testauthgas1.gs:512` |

**Finding:** Fully compliant. The escalating lockout mechanism in the HIPAA preset goes well beyond the minimum requirement. Failed login attempts are tracked, rate-limited, and audited.

---

### #17 — Security Incident Response ✅ Implemented

**CFR:** §164.308(a)(6)(ii) — **Required**

| Aspect | Evidence | File:Line |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| Incident detection | `security_alert` events for HMAC mismatches, missing secrets, suspicious activity | Throughout `testauthgas1.gs` |
| Client-side reporting | `_reportSecurityEvent()` sends blocked attacks to GAS backend | `testauthgas1.html:1232+` |
| Security event logging | Dedicated security event processing with rate limiting | `testauthgas1.gs:1100-1132` — `processSecurityEvent()` |
| Flood prevention | Max 50 security events per 5-minute window | `testauthgas1.gs:1104-1131` |

**Finding:** Compliant at the technical level. The code detects, logs, and responds to security incidents (HMAC failures, rate limit breaches, tampered messages). The client-side reporting pipeline sends blocked attacks to the server for audit logging.

**Note:** Incident *response procedures* (who to notify, how to investigate) are organizational — they would need to be documented in a separate policy.

---

### #18 — 6-Year Retention ⚠️ Partial

**CFR:** §164.316(b)(2)(i) — **Required**

| Aspect | Evidence | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Configured retention | `AUDIT_LOG_RETENTION_YEARS: 6` | ✅ `testauthgas1.gs:96` |
| **Actual enforcement** | No automated retention enforcement code | ❌ No code to purge records after 6 years |
| **No auto-delete protection** | No code to prevent premature deletion | ❌ Spreadsheet data can be manually deleted |
| Google Sheets retention | Google retains spreadsheet data indefinitely unless deleted | ⚠️ Infrastructure-level only |

**Finding:** Partially compliant. The configuration declares 6-year retention, but there is no code to enforce it. Google Sheets will retain the data indefinitely by default, which passively meets the requirement — but there is no automated archival, no retention locks, and no protection against accidental deletion.

**Gap:** The `AUDIT_LOG_RETENTION_YEARS: 6` config value is never read by any code — it's a declaration, not an enforcement mechanism. Need: (a) scheduled archival of old audit data, (b) protection against premature deletion.

---

### #19 — Disclosure Accounting ❌ Not Implemented

**CFR:** §164.528 — **Required** (Privacy Rule)

| Aspect | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Disclosure log | ❌ Not implemented | No mechanism to track who PHI was disclosed *to* (external parties) |
| 6-year history | ❌ Not implemented | Cannot generate a report of disclosures for any individual |
| On-demand reporting | ❌ Not implemented | No endpoint or function to produce an accounting |

**Finding:** Not compliant. The audit log tracks internal *access* to ePHI (who logged in, who saved a note) but does not track *disclosures* — instances where PHI was shared with external parties, other entities, or for purposes beyond treatment/payment/operations. This is a Privacy Rule requirement that would need a separate disclosure tracking system.

**Note:** If the application never discloses PHI to external parties (all data stays within the system), the exemptions in §164.528 may cover most scenarios (treatment, payment, operations are exempt from accounting). However, the capability must exist for non-exempt disclosures.

---

## 4. Data Integrity (Items #20-21)

### #20 — ePHI Integrity ✅ Implemented

**CFR:** §164.312(c)(1) — **Addressable**

| Aspect | Evidence | File:Line |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| HMAC-SHA256 session integrity | Session data signed with HMAC on creation and verified on every access | `testauthgas1.gs:406-440` |
| Fail-closed design | Missing HMAC secret prevents session creation entirely | `testauthgas1.gs:410-416` — throws Error |
| Tampered session rejection | HMAC mismatch → session destroyed + security alert | `testauthgas1.gs:651-656` |
| Message integrity | All postMessage communications signed with per-session HMAC key | `testauthgas1.gs:453-475` |

**Finding:** Fully compliant. The HMAC-SHA256 integrity verification ensures that session data has not been altered or destroyed in an unauthorized manner. The fail-closed design (missing secret = deny) is a strong security posture.

---

### #21 — Mechanism to Authenticate ePHI ✅ Implemented

**CFR:** §164.312(c)(2) — **Addressable**

| Aspect | Evidence | File:Line |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| HMAC verification on every access | `verifySessionHmac()` called in `validateSession()` and `validateSessionForData()` | `testauthgas1.gs:650-656,736-741` |
| Integrity violation detection | Unauthorized alteration detected and logged as `hmac_mismatch` | `testauthgas1.gs:652-653` |
| Client-side verification | Host page verifies HMAC signatures on incoming messages | `testauthgas1.html:1303-1320` |

**Finding:** Fully compliant. The system can detect unauthorized alteration of ePHI (specifically session data and inter-frame messages). Both server-side and client-side verification mechanisms are in place.

---

## 5. Privacy Rule — Data Handling (Items #22-27)

### #22 — Minimum Necessary ⚠️ Partial

**CFR:** §164.502(b) — **Required**

| Aspect | Status | Evidence |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Session data | ✅ Only email and displayName stored — access token discarded after validation | `testauthgas1.gs:596-597` — comment: "accessToken intentionally NOT stored" |
| Audit log data | ✅ Session tokens truncated to 8 chars in logs | `testauthgas1.gs:791` — `sessionToken.substring(0, 8)` |
| API responses | ⚠️ `saveNote()` returns the full note text back to the client | `testauthgas1.gs:799` |
| **Field-level filtering** | ❌ No mechanism to return different data subsets based on role | No RBAC |
| **Data query scope** | 🔄 N/A — testauthgas1 is a test environment with minimal data operations | Only `saveNote()` exists |

**Finding:** Partially compliant. The implementation follows minimum necessary for internal data handling (token discarded, session IDs truncated). However, there is no field-level filtering on data returns, and all authorized users see the same data. For a production system with real ePHI, this would need RBAC-gated data views.

---

### #23 — Right of Access ❌ Not Implemented

**CFR:** §164.524 — **Required**

| Aspect | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Data export | ❌ | No mechanism for individuals to request and download their ePHI |
| Format selection | ❌ | No format options (PDF, CSV, JSON, etc.) |
| 30-day response | 📋 | Organizational process — not enforced in code |

**Finding:** Not implemented. The application has no data export functionality. In a production deployment, you would need an endpoint or workflow that allows individuals to request a copy of their PHI in electronic format.

**Mitigation:** Since testauthgas1 stores minimal data (only test notes in a spreadsheet), the right of access could currently be fulfilled manually (admin exports from Google Sheets). This would not scale.

---

### #24 — Right to Amendment ❌ Not Implemented

**CFR:** §164.526 — **Required**

| Aspect | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Amendment requests | ❌ | No mechanism for individuals to request corrections |
| Append-only history | ❌ | No versioning or amendment tracking on records |
| Denial documentation | ❌ | No workflow for denying amendments with documentation |

**Finding:** Not implemented. The application has no concept of record amendment. `saveNote()` creates records but there is no update, versioning, or amendment workflow. For production, you would need: (a) amendment request submission, (b) review workflow, (c) append-only history (never delete, only annotate), (d) denial documentation.

---

### #25 — De-Identification (Safe Harbor) 🔄 Not Applicable

**CFR:** §164.514(b)(2) — Standard

**Finding:** Not applicable. The testauthgas1 environment does not de-identify data for research or secondary use. If de-identification is needed in the future, the 18-identifier stripping process documented in `HIPAA-CODING-REQUIREMENTS.md` Section 11 must be followed.

---

### #26 — De-Identification (Expert) 🔄 Not Applicable

**CFR:** §164.514(b)(1) — Standard

**Finding:** Not applicable. Same as #25.

---

### #27 — Re-Identification Codes 🔄 Not Applicable

**CFR:** §164.514(c) — Standard

**Finding:** Not applicable. No de-identification/re-identification needed in current scope.

---

## 6. Breach Preparedness (Items #28-31)

### #28 — Breach Detection ⚠️ Partial

**CFR:** §164.404

| Aspect | Status | Evidence |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Unauthorized access detection | ✅ Logged via `security_alert` events | Throughout `testauthgas1.gs` |
| HMAC integrity violation alerts | ✅ Detected and logged | `testauthgas1.gs:652-653` |
| Escalating lockout (brute force) | ✅ Tier 3 locks account for 6 hours | `testauthgas1.gs:511-514` |
| Client-side attack reporting | ✅ `_reportSecurityEvent()` sends to backend | `testauthgas1.html:1232+` |
| **Anomalous pattern detection** | ❌ No heuristic analysis (unusual access times, geographic anomalies) | Not implemented |
| **Automated alerts** | ❌ No email/SMS alerting on suspicious activity | Not implemented |

**Finding:** Partially compliant. The code detects and logs many breach indicators (HMAC failures, brute force, tampered messages). However, there is no automated alerting — a human must review the audit log to discover a breach. For production, you need real-time alerting (email, SMS, or dashboard) when security events exceed a threshold.

---

### #29 — Breach Scope Assessment ✅ Implemented

**CFR:** §164.404(c)

| Aspect | Evidence | File:Line |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| Data-level audit trail | `DataAuditLog` links access events to specific records | `testauthgas1.gs:387-396` — user, action, resourceType, resourceId |
| Session-to-user mapping | Every data operation tied to authenticated user | `testauthgas1.gs:780` — `validateSessionForData()` |
| Emergency access flagging | Emergency access events separately identified | `testauthgas1.gs:395` — `IsEmergencyAccess` column |

**Finding:** Compliant. The data audit log captures enough detail to determine which individuals' PHI was accessed — who accessed what record, when, via what session, and whether it was emergency access. This is sufficient to scope a breach.

---

### #30 — Encryption Safe Harbor 📋 Policy/Process

**CFR:** §164.402

**Finding:** This is primarily an organizational/legal determination. From a code perspective:
- **In transit:** ePHI is encrypted via TLS (HTTPS) — qualifies as secured
- **At rest:** Google provides AES-256 encryption at the infrastructure level — qualifies as secured
- **In CacheService:** Server-side cache; Google manages encryption — qualifies as secured

If all ePHI is properly encrypted at rest and in transit (it is, via Google's infrastructure), then unauthorized access to the encrypted data would NOT constitute a notifiable breach. This safe harbor should be documented in the entity's breach response policy.

---

### #31 — Breach Logging ❌ Not Implemented

**CFR:** §164.408(c)

| Aspect | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Dedicated breach log | ❌ | No separate breach tracking mechanism |
| Breach documentation | ❌ | No structured format for documenting breaches |
| 6-year retention | ❌ | No breach-specific retention |

**Finding:** Not implemented. While security incidents are logged in the audit trail, there is no dedicated breach log that would track: confirmed breaches, risk assessments, notification timelines, affected individuals, and remediation actions. This is needed for §164.408 (reporting breaches to HHS) and §164.414 (demonstrating compliance).

---

## 7. Infrastructure & Operations (Items #32-40)

### #32 — Data Backup 📋 Policy/Process

**CFR:** §164.308(a)(7)(ii)(A) — **Required**

**Finding:** Google Sheets provides built-in revision history (effectively versioned backups). GAS CacheService data is ephemeral by design (max 6-hour TTL). No application-level backup mechanism exists in the code. Backup is handled at the infrastructure level by Google's platform.

### #33 — Disaster Recovery 📋 Policy/Process

**CFR:** §164.308(a)(7)(ii)(B) — **Required**

**Finding:** The GAS self-update mechanism (`pullAndDeployFromGitHub()`) provides code-level disaster recovery — the script can be redeployed from GitHub at any time. Data recovery depends on Google Sheets (revision history) and Google's infrastructure redundancy. No application-level DR procedures exist in code.

### #34 — Emergency Mode Operations 📋 Policy/Process

**CFR:** §164.308(a)(7)(ii)(C) — **Required**

**Finding:** The emergency access mechanism (#3) provides access during authentication emergencies. For broader system emergencies (GAS outage, Google infrastructure failure), there is no degraded-mode feature. This is an organizational/infrastructure concern more than a coding concern.

### Items #35-40 — NPRM Proposed Requirements 🔮

All six items (72-Hour Recovery, Patch Management, Vulnerability Scanning, Penetration Testing, Network Segmentation, Asset Inventory) are proposed requirements that are not yet law. They are included in `HIPAA-CODING-REQUIREMENTS.md` for forward planning. Current assessment:

| # | Requirement | Readiness |
|---|---|---|
| 35 | 72-Hour Recovery | ⚠️ GitHub-based code recovery possible; data recovery via Google Sheets revision history |
| 36 | Patch Management | ❌ No patch management pipeline for GAS dependencies |
| 37 | Vulnerability Scanning | ❌ No automated scanning |
| 38 | Penetration Testing | ❌ Not performed |
| 39 | Network Segmentation | ⚠️ GAS runs in Google's isolated sandbox; GitHub Pages is static — inherently segmented |
| 40 | Asset Inventory | ❌ No formal technology asset inventory |

## Priority Gap Analysis

### Critical Gaps (Current Law — Must Fix for Compliance)

| Priority | Item | Gap | Remediation |
|----------|------|-----|-------------|
| 🔴 **P1** | #19 — Disclosure Accounting | No mechanism to track PHI disclosures to external parties | Build disclosure tracking system with 6-year history and on-demand reporting |
| 🔴 **P1** | #23 — Right of Access | No data export for individuals | Build data export endpoint (JSON/CSV) that returns all PHI for a given individual |
| 🔴 **P1** | #24 — Right to Amendment | No amendment workflow | Build append-only record amendment with review/deny workflow |
| 🟡 **P2** | #5 — Access Authorization | Binary access only — no RBAC | Implement role-based access control (admin, clinician, billing, viewer) |
| 🟡 **P2** | #18 — 6-Year Retention | Configuration declared but not enforced | Build retention enforcement (archive old records, prevent premature deletion) |
| 🟡 **P2** | #28 — Breach Detection | No automated alerting | Add email/SMS alerts for security event thresholds |
| 🟡 **P2** | #31 — Breach Logging | No dedicated breach log | Build breach tracking with documentation, timeline, and affected individual tracking |

### Strengths (Exceeding Requirements)

| Item | Strength |
|------|----------|
| #4 — Automatic Logoff | Both rolling AND absolute timeouts — exceeds minimum |
| #12 — Transmission Integrity | HMAC-SHA256 message-level integrity on top of TLS — defense-in-depth |
| #14 — Audit Controls | Dual audit logs (session + data-level) — exceeds baseline |
| #16 — Log-in Monitoring | Three-tier escalating lockout — exceeds "monitor and report" requirement |
| #20-21 — Data Integrity | Fail-closed HMAC with non-extractable client-side keys — exceeds verification requirement |

### Test Configuration Warning

The following values are set to test values (`⚡ TEST VALUE`) and MUST be changed before production deployment:

| Config | Test Value | Production Value | Location |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| `SESSION_EXPIRATION` | 180s (3min) | 900s (15min) | `testauthgas1.gs:81,82` |
| `ABSOLUTE_SESSION_TIMEOUT` | 300s (5min) | 28800s (8hr) | `testauthgas1.gs:83,84` |
| `HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL` | 30s | 300s (5min) | `testauthgas1.gs:86,87` |
| `OAUTH_TOKEN_LIFETIME` | 180s (3min) | 3600s (1hr) | `testauthgas1.gs:89,90` |
| `OAUTH_REFRESH_BUFFER` | 60s (1min) | 300s (5min) | `testauthgas1.gs:91,92` |
| `HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL` (HTML) | 30000ms | 300000ms (5min) | `testauthgas1.html:391` |
