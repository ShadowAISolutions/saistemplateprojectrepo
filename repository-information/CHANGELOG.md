## [Unreleased]

## [v01.03r] — 2026-03-08 02:31:16 PM EST

### Removed
- Removed testation7 and testation8 environments — deleted HTML pages, GAS scripts, config files, version files, changelogs, and changelog archives (18 files total)
- Removed testation7 and testation8 GAS deploy steps from auto-merge workflow
- Removed testation7 and testation8 entries from STATUS.md hosted pages and GAS projects tables

## [v01.02r] — 2026-03-08 02:05:10 PM EST

### Fixed
- Fixed non-index page URLs in chat bookends ending with `/` instead of `.html` — added explicit rule for non-index pages (e.g. `testation7.html`) to use `.html` suffix in live site URLs
- Fixed init script not resetting `TEMPLATE_DEPLOY` to `Off` on forks — forks no longer inherit the template's `On` state, preventing false template-repo detection in URL display logic

## [v01.01r] — 2026-03-07 03:15:58 PM EST

### Changed
- Re-enabled `TEMPLATE_DEPLOY` toggle (`Off` → `On`) to restore GitHub Pages deployment on the template repo
