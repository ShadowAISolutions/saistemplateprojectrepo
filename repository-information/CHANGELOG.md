## [Unreleased]

## [v01.21r] — 2026-03-08 05:14:03 PM EST

### Changed
- Added compaction recovery closure rule to CLAUDE.md — after context compaction, if no work remains, the recovery response must still end with the full end-of-response block and closing marker instead of informal text

## [v01.20r] — 2026-03-08 05:07:22 PM EST

### Changed
- Consolidated all template files into `live-site-pages/templates/` — moved `HtmlAndGasTemplateAutoUpdate.html` (renamed to `.html.txt`) and `gas-project-creator-code.js.txt` from separate directories into a single templates folder
- Removed `live-site-templates/` and `live-site-pages/gas-code-templates/` directories
- Updated all references across 15 files (CLAUDE.md, rules, skills, scripts, ARCHITECTURE.md, README.md, STATUS.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, IMPROVEMENTS.md)

#### `gas-project-creator.html` — v01.01w

##### Changed
- Updated template file fetch path to new location

## [v01.19r] — 2026-03-08 04:54:56 PM EST

### Changed
- Merged "Hosted Pages" and "GAS Projects" into a single "Hosted Pages & GAS Projects" table in STATUS.md — each page row now shows its associated GAS file and version inline

## [v01.18r] — 2026-03-08 04:49:52 PM EST

### Changed
- Clarified template names in STATUS.md — renamed "Universal Template" to "HTML Page Template (with GAS embedding)" and "GAS Code Template" to "GAS Script Template" for unambiguous identification

## [v01.17r] — 2026-03-08 04:46:19 PM EST

### Changed
- Added GAS Code Template entry to STATUS.md Templates table — `gas-project-creator-code.js.txt` is now tracked alongside the Universal Template as the GAS-specific code template

## [v01.16r] — 2026-03-08 04:25:29 PM EST

### Fixed
- Corrected QR code to point to GitHub repo URL instead of GitHub Pages URL
- Updated Pre-Commit #14 rule and init script to generate QR codes with the repo URL
- Fixed stale `HtmlTemplateAutoUpdate` file references in `html-pages.md` and `imported--frontend-design` skill after repo rename

## [v01.15r] — 2026-03-08 04:19:59 PM EST

### Fixed
- Regenerated QR code in README to point to the correct live site URL after repo rename

## [v01.14r] — 2026-03-08 04:08:05 PM EST

### Changed
- Renamed project from "Auto Update HTML Template" to "Auto Update HTML & GAS Template" in README title, init script, and phantom update commit message references

## [v01.13r] — 2026-03-08 03:48:05 PM EST

### Changed
- Renamed all instances of `htmltemplateautoupdate` to `saistemplateprojectrepo` across the entire repo (13 files, 41 occurrences) in preparation for repo copy/rename

## [v01.12r] — 2026-03-08 03:38:44 PM EST

### Removed
- Deleted `repository-information/backups/CLAUDE.md.bak` and the `backups/` directory (stale backup no longer needed)

## [v01.11r] — 2026-03-08 03:34:16 PM EST

### Changed
- Extended STATUS.md Origin column to four-tier system: `template`, `initialized`, `modified`, `initialized · modified`, or empty (fork-added) — matching the README tree and ARCHITECTURE.md label tiers
- Updated Pre-Commit #5 with transition rules: `initialized` → `initialized · modified` and `template` → `modified` on post-init file edits

## [v01.10r] — 2026-03-08 03:31:41 PM EST

### Changed
- Upgraded template origin labels from three-tier to four-tier system: added `[template · initialized · modified]` state to distinguish post-init customizations of init-modified files from post-init customizations of untouched template files
- Made init script Phase 5b surgical — only upgrades `[template]` → `[template · initialized]` for files that init actually modifies (based on REPLACE_FILES array), leaving untouched template files as `[template]`
- Updated Pre-Commit #6 (ARCHITECTURE.md) and #8 (README tree) rules: `[template · initialized]` → `[template · initialized · modified]` on post-init edit; `[template]` → `[template · modified]` on post-init edit

## [v01.09r] — 2026-03-08 03:23:13 PM EST

### Added
- Added three-tier template origin label system: `[template]` (template repo), `[template · initialized]` (fork after init), `[template · modified]` (fork after customization) — distinguishes initialization changes from genuine post-init customizations
- Added Phase 5b to init script (`scripts/init-repo.sh`) — upgrades all `[template]` labels to `[template · initialized]` in README.md tree, ARCHITECTURE.md diagram, and STATUS.md Origin column during fork initialization

### Changed
- Updated Pre-Commit #5, #6, #8 template origin label rules to document the three-tier system and the `[template · initialized]` intermediate state

## [v01.08r] — 2026-03-08 03:12:53 PM EST

### Added
- Added `[template]` origin labels to ARCHITECTURE.md Mermaid diagram — file nodes and file-centric subgraphs are prefixed with `[template]` to distinguish template-origin components from fork-added ones
- Added `Origin` column to all STATUS.md tables — template-origin entries show `template`, making it immediately visible which rows came from the template
- Added template origin label rules to Pre-Commit #5 (STATUS.md Origin column) and #6 (ARCHITECTURE.md node/subgraph labels), including `[template · modified]` tracking on non-template repos

## [v01.07r] — 2026-03-08 03:04:33 PM EST

### Added
- Added `[template · modified]` label rule to Pre-Commit #8 — on non-template repos, template-origin files update their label to `[template · modified]` when edited, showing the file was customized from the original template

## [v01.06r] — 2026-03-08 03:01:03 PM EST

### Added
- Added `[template]` origin labels to every entry in README project structure tree — distinguishes template-origin files from files added in forks

## [v01.05r] — 2026-03-08 02:53:07 PM EST

### Fixed
- Added missing sound files (`Website_Ready_Voice_1.mp3`, `Code_Ready_Voice_1.mp3`) to README project structure tree — `sounds/` directory was listed but its contents were not expanded
- Added completeness audit rule to Pre-Commit #8 (README.md structure tree) — directories must have their contents fully expanded, not just listed as leaf nodes

## [v01.04r] — 2026-03-08 02:48:28 PM EST

### Fixed
- Added missing `.editorconfig` and `.gitignore` to README project structure tree

## [v01.03r] — 2026-03-08 02:31:16 PM EST

### Removed
- Removed testation7 and testation8 environments — deleted HTML pages, GAS scripts, config files, version files, changelogs, and changelog archives (18 files total)
- Removed testation7 and testation8 GAS deploy steps from auto-merge workflow
- Removed testation7 and testation8 entries from STATUS.md hosted pages and GAS projects tables

## [v01.02r] — 2026-03-08 02:05:10 PM EST

### Fixed
- Fixed non-index page URLs in chat bookends ending with `/` instead of `.html` — added explicit rule for non-index pages (e.g. `testation7.html`) to use `.html` suffix in live site URLs
- Fixed init script not resetting `TEMPLATE_DEPLOY` to `Off` on forks — forks no longer inherit the template's `On` state, preventing false template-repo detection in URL display logic

## [v01.01r] — 2026-03-07 03:15:58 PM EST

### Changed
- Re-enabled `TEMPLATE_DEPLOY` toggle (`Off` → `On`) to restore GitHub Pages deployment on the template repo
