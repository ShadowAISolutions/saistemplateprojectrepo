## [Unreleased]

## [v02.93r] — 2026-03-13 08:37:51 PM EST

### Fixed
- Fixed session timeout race condition — when a heartbeat was in-flight and the countdown hit 0, the client would sign the user out before the server response could extend the session. Added a 15-second grace period that shows "extending..." while waiting for the heartbeat response

#### `testauth1.html` — v01.29w

##### Fixed
- Session no longer times out while a heartbeat response is in transit — shows "extending..." instead of immediately signing out

## [v02.92r] — 2026-03-13 08:14:29 PM EST

### Fixed
- Fixed GAS changelog popup not showing version headers with timestamps — the `parseGasChangelog` regex was missing the `v` prefix in the version capture group (`[\d.]+g` → `v[\d.]+g`), causing all `## [vXX.XXg]` headers to be silently skipped while entries were shown without grouping

#### `testauth1.html` — v01.28w

##### Fixed
- Version headers now appear in the GAS changelog popup with timestamps

#### `index.html` — v01.03w

##### Fixed
- Version headers now appear in the GAS changelog popup with timestamps

#### `testenvironment.html` — v01.03w

##### Fixed
- Version headers now appear in the GAS changelog popup with timestamps

#### `gas-project-creator.html` — v01.10w

##### Fixed
- Version headers now appear in the GAS changelog popup with timestamps

## [v02.91r] — 2026-03-13 08:03:00 PM EST

### Changed
- Propagated all security hardening from testauth1 to auth templates — both `gas-minimal-auth-template-code.js.txt` and `HtmlAndGasTemplateAutoUpdate-auth.html.txt` now include the full 6-phase security implementation so new GAS projects created via setup-gas-project.sh inherit all defenses by default

### Security
- **Auth GAS template** — added PARENT_ORIGIN derivation, `escapeHtml()`/`escapeJs()` XSS prevention, expanded HMAC payload, per-session message signing key, `messageKey` in session responses, error sanitization, all `"*"` → `PARENT_ORIGIN` on postMessages, removed `accessToken` from session storage
- **Auth HTML template** — added message-type allowlist (8 known types), cryptographic message signature verification, `msgKey` parameter on heartbeat iframe URLs, removed debug console.logs, removed broken OAuth revocation, fixed checkmark encoding

## [v02.90r] — 2026-03-13 07:15:58 PM EST

### Added
- Defense-in-depth security hardening for testauth1 environment (6-phase implementation from SECURITY-UPDATE-PLAN-TESTAUTH1.md)

### Security
- **Message-type allowlist** (HTML) — postMessage listener now only processes 8 known GAS message types, rejecting all others
- **Cryptographic message authentication** (GAS→HTML) — per-session HMAC key signs all GAS outgoing postMessages; HTML parent verifies signatures before processing security-sensitive messages
- **XSS prevention** (GAS) — added `escapeHtml()`/`escapeJs()` helpers and applied to all user-controlled interpolation points in GAS-generated HTML
- **Session hardening** (GAS) — removed stored OAuth access token from session cache (least privilege), expanded HMAC payload to cover all security-relevant fields
- **postMessage target origin** (GAS) — replaced `"*"` with `PARENT_ORIGIN` (derived from `EMBED_PAGE_URL` with mandatory `.toLowerCase()`) on all 15 GAS→parent postMessage calls
- **Error message sanitization** (GAS) — token exchange errors now log details server-side only, returning generic "server_error" to client
- **Debug log cleanup** (both) — removed all `[AUTH DEBUG]` and `[GAS DEBUG]` console.log statements from production code
- **OAuth revocation fix** (HTML) — removed broken `google.accounts.oauth2.revoke(session.token)` call that was passing the server session token instead of the OAuth access token

#### `testauth1.html` — v01.27w

##### Added
- Message-type allowlist for postMessage security
- Cryptographic message signature verification for GAS messages

##### Changed
- Heartbeat iframe now passes message signing key for signature verification

##### Fixed
- Removed broken OAuth token revocation that was passing wrong token type

##### Removed
- Debug console.log statements from authentication flow

#### `testauth1.gs` — v01.15g

##### Added
- `escapeHtml()` and `escapeJs()` XSS prevention helpers
- `PARENT_ORIGIN` constant for restricted postMessage targeting
- Per-session message signing key generation and message signing
- Server-side error logging for token exchange failures

##### Changed
- All postMessage calls now target `PARENT_ORIGIN` instead of `"*"`
- HMAC payload expanded to include all security-relevant session fields
- OAuth access token no longer stored in session cache

##### Removed
- Debug console.log statement from token exchange response

## [v02.89r] — 2026-03-13 07:00:04 PM EST

### Changed
- Corrected security update plan failure analysis (`repository-information/SECURITY-UPDATE-PLAN-TESTAUTH1.md`) — identified that GAS was stuck at v01.15g from v02.79r onward because DEPLOY_SECRET broke auto-deploy, meaning all subsequent GAS-side fixes (v02.80r–v02.82r) never deployed to the live environment. Corrected false lessons: PARENT_ORIGIN case mismatch (not `.toLowerCase()`) was the actual root cause of persistent sign-in failure; TOKEN_EXCHANGE_METHOD='postMessage' was never properly tested (revert never deployed). Added `.toLowerCase()` to Phase 6 PARENT_ORIGIN derivation to prevent repeating the v02.79r bug

## [v02.88r] — 2026-03-13 06:46:07 PM EST

### Added
- Comprehensive security update plan for testauth1 (`repository-information/SECURITY-UPDATE-PLAN-TESTAUTH1.md`) — implementation-ready plan covering 6 phases: message-type allowlist, cryptographic message authentication, XSS prevention, session hardening, debug cleanup, error sanitization, and postMessage target origin restriction. Includes complete failure analysis of v02.75r–v02.84r (the two previous reverted attempts) with root causes documented for each, and explicit "never touch" constraints for the deploy handler and sign-in flow

## [v02.87r] — 2026-03-13 06:13:23 PM EST

### Changed
- Rotated 92 CHANGELOG sections (v02.68r–v01.77r) to archive — all non-today sections moved to CHANGELOG-archive.md with SHA enrichment for 6 versions (v02.63r–v02.68r); 86 older versions moved as-is (commits pre-date local git history)

## [v02.86r] — 2026-03-13 06:03:16 PM EST

### Added
- Protective `⚠️ CRITICAL` comment block in all GAS deploy handlers (`doPost(action=deploy)`) warning against adding authentication or guards — prevents silent breakage of the auto-update pipeline
- Deploy Handler Protection rule in `.claude/rules/gas-scripts.md` documenting why the deploy endpoint must remain unauthenticated, what happened when auth was added (v02.79r), and the pattern to watch for

#### `testauth1.gs` — v01.14g

##### Added
- Minor internal improvements

## [v02.85r] — 2026-03-13 05:44:18 PM EST

### Changed
- Full repo revert to v02.74r state — undoes all changes from v02.75r through v02.84r (security hardening, postMessage fixes, security action plan, template propagation)
- Removed `repository-information/SECURITY-ACTION-PLAN.md` (created in v02.78r)

#### `testauth1.html` — v01.26w (reverted from v01.35w)

##### Changed
- Reverted to v01.26w state — undoes security hardening changes (CSP meta tag, origin validation, postMessage security, CSRF token handling) that were applied in v02.75r–v02.84r

#### `testauth1.gs` — v01.13g (reverted from v01.17g)

##### Changed
- Reverted to v01.13g state — undoes server-side security hardening (state parameter validation, origin checks, action allowlists) from v02.79r–v02.84r

## [v02.74r] — 2026-03-13 12:58:17 PM EST

### Changed
- Removed "Back to Table of Contents" link from Project Structure section since it's directly adjacent to the TOC

## [v02.73r] — 2026-03-13 12:55:44 PM EST

### Added
- "Back to Table of Contents" shortcut links under each section heading in README.md for quick navigation back to the TOC

## [v02.72r] — 2026-03-13 12:52:19 PM EST

### Added
- Table of contents section in README.md with anchor links to all major sections, placed between the QR code and Project Structure

## [v02.71r] — 2026-03-13 12:32:54 PM EST

### Added
- Comprehensive Microsoft authentication implementation plan (`MICROSOFT-AUTH-PLAN.md`) — covers MSAL.js integration, Azure AD setup, provider toggle architecture, GAS-side token validation via Microsoft Graph, and HTML-side dual sign-in UI

## [v02.70r] — 2026-03-13 11:32:09 AM EST

### Fixed
- Removed automatic silent OAuth sign-in on page load — the Google account picker popup no longer fires when refreshing the auth wall page; sign-in only triggers when the user clicks "Sign In with Google"
- Reverted incorrect SIGNED_OUT_FLAG approach from v02.69r

#### `testauth1.html` — v01.26w

##### Fixed
- Page refresh on "Sign In Required" screen no longer auto-triggers Google sign-in popup

#### `HtmlAndGasTemplateAutoUpdate-auth.html.txt` — v01.26w (no change)

##### Fixed
- Same fix applied to auth HTML template for future pages

## [v02.69r] — 2026-03-13 11:23:50 AM EST

### Fixed
- Fixed auto sign-in after manual sign-out on auth pages — signing out and refreshing no longer silently re-authenticates; the account picker is now shown

#### `testauth1.html` — v01.25w

##### Fixed
- Fixed sign-out followed by page refresh auto-signing back in without account picker

#### `HtmlAndGasTemplateAutoUpdate-auth.html.txt` — v01.25w (no change)

##### Fixed
- Same sign-out fix applied to auth HTML template for future pages
