# Offensive Security Tests — testauth1

These tests simulate real attacks against the testauth1 authentication system.
Unlike the built-in defensive tests (which inspect code structure), these tests
act as an **outside attacker** — sending malicious payloads and observing how
the system responds in real time.

## Prerequisites

```bash
pip install playwright
playwright install chromium
```

## How to Run

Each test is a standalone Python script. Run them one at a time:

```bash
python tests/offensive-security/test_01_xss_postmessage.py
python tests/offensive-security/test_02_session_forgery.py
python tests/offensive-security/test_03_message_type_injection.py
python tests/offensive-security/test_04_csrf_token_replay.py
python tests/offensive-security/test_05_clickjacking_iframe_embedding.py
python tests/offensive-security/test_06_deploy_endpoint_abuse.py
python tests/offensive-security/test_07_session_race_timing.py
python tests/offensive-security/test_08_csp_bypass_resource_injection.py
python tests/offensive-security/test_09_auth_state_manipulation.py
```

## What These Tests Do

| Test | Attack Vector | What It Verifies |
|------|--------------|-----------------|
| 01 | XSS via postMessage injection | Message allowlist blocks unknown types; signature verification rejects unsigned messages |
| 02 | Session token forgery & fixation | Forged session tokens are rejected by the GAS backend; localStorage can't be poisoned |
| 03 | Message type spoofing | Attacker-crafted messages mimicking legitimate GAS types are rejected by signature verification |
| 04 | OAuth token replay & CSRF | Replayed/fabricated OAuth tokens fail server-side validation; nonce prevents CSRF |
| 05 | Clickjacking & iframe embedding | CSP frame-ancestors, X-Frame-Options, and framebusting prevent unauthorized framing |
| 06 | Deploy endpoint abuse | doPost(action=deploy) doesn't leak secrets; error messages are safe; no hidden actions |
| 07 | Session race conditions & timing | First-write-wins prevents flood attacks; BroadcastChannel can't hijack sessions; server-side timeout is authoritative |
| 08 | CSP bypass & resource injection | CSP policy audit; eval availability; data exfiltration vectors; base URI hijack prevention |
| 09 | Auth state manipulation | DOM bypass doesn't expose data; monkey-patching security functions requires XSS; server validates all sessions |

## Safety

- These tests run against the **live deployed page** on GitHub Pages
- They do NOT modify any server-side state permanently
- They do NOT require valid credentials
- They operate in an isolated browser context (Playwright)
- All attacks are contained to the test browser session

## Expected Results

Every test should show the attack being **blocked** by one or more defense layers.
If any attack succeeds, you've found a real vulnerability that needs fixing.
