# HTML Authentication Layer — Independent Security Audit

**Audit Date:** 2026-03-16
**Auditor Perspective:** Red Team + Blue Team + HIPAA Compliance
**Target:** `testauth1.html` — Client-side authentication layer
**Context:** Pre-GAS-layer review; potential EMR use case (HIPAA-regulated)

> This review was conducted with fresh eyes using online research, current OWASP guidance,
> HIPAA 2025/2026 NPRM requirements, and Google Cloud threat intelligence — not from
> internal documentation. The goal is to be brutally honest about what we're missing.

## Findings Chart

### CRITICAL — Must fix before any PHI touches this system

| # | Finding | Severity | HIPAA Impact | Attack Vector | Status |
|---|---------|----------|-------------|---------------|--------|
| C-1 | **Non-cryptographic hash (DJB2) used for message signing** | CRITICAL | Fails Technical Safeguard §164.312(e)(1) — integrity controls | Attacker with XSS brute-forces 32-bit DJB2 hash in ~65K attempts (~milliseconds on modern hardware). Can forge any signed message. Birthday attack finds collisions in ~256 attempts. | NOT ADDRESSED |
| C-2 | **`postMessage` sends Google access token with `'*'` targetOrigin** | CRITICAL | Token exposure to unauthorized party | If GAS iframe navigates to unexpected origin (redirect, compromise), token goes to attacker. OWASP explicitly warns: "always specify an exact target origin." Code comment says "required" — needs re-evaluation. | KNOWN CONSTRAINT — not mitigated |
| C-3 | **Third-party IP lookup (api.ipify.org) without BAA** | CRITICAL | HIPAA violation — PHI disclosure to non-BA third party | User's IP (PHI per OCR guidance) is sent to ipify.org. No BAA exists. Domain appears in malware IOC lists. Enterprise firewalls may block it. | NOT ADDRESSED |
| C-4 | **No Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** | CRITICAL | Fails 2026 HIPAA NPRM mandatory MFA requirement | Google SSO is single-factor (something you know — Google password). HIPAA 2026 eliminates "addressable" loopholes — MFA becomes mandatory for all ePHI access. | NOT ADDRESSED |
| C-5 | **Session token stored in sessionStorage — accessible to any same-origin JS** | CRITICAL | No HttpOnly equivalent — token readable by XSS | sessionStorage has no HttpOnly flag. Any JS on the page can read `gas_session_token`. NIST 800-63B §7.1: "Secrets used for session binding SHOULD NOT be placed in insecure locations such as HTML5 Local Storage." sessionStorage has the same vulnerability class. | ARCHITECTURAL LIMITATION |

### HIGH — Significant security gaps

| # | Finding | Severity | HIPAA Impact | Attack Vector | Status |
|---|---------|----------|-------------|---------------|--------|
| H-1 | **BroadcastChannel transmits session token + messageKey in plaintext** | HIGH | Sensitive credentials broadcast to all same-origin tabs | `broadcastTabClaim()` sends `{token, email, messageKey}` over BroadcastChannel. Any same-origin tab (including one with XSS) intercepts all three values — full session hijacking material. | NOT ADDRESSED |
| H-2 | **No origin validation on incoming postMessages** | HIGH | Accepts messages from any origin on allowlisted types | `window.addEventListener('message', ...)` checks `data.type` against allowlist but never checks `event.origin`. Any window (cross-origin attacker page) can send `gas-ready-for-token` or `gas-needs-auth`. | NOT ADDRESSED |
| H-3 | **`_messageKey` nullified in multiple places, re-enabling first-write-wins bypass** | HIGH | Session integrity compromise | `_messageKey` is set to `null` in: reauth button handler, "Use Here" handler, tab-claim receiver, clearSession(). Each nullification reopens the first-write-wins window for an attacker to inject a new key via a forged `gas-session-created`. | PARTIAL — first-write-wins exists but multiple reset points weaken it |
| H-4 | **Client-side session expiry timers are authoritative** | HIGH | Session timeout bypass | `SERVER_SESSION_DURATION` and `ABSOLUTE_SESSION_DURATION` are JS variables. An attacker (via XSS or DevTools on a shared computer) sets them to `999999`, preventing client-side expiry. Server-side expiry still works, but the UI never forces re-auth. | PARTIAL — server validates, but client UI is bypassable |
| H-5 | **Heartbeat sends session token in URL parameter** | HIGH | Token in server logs, browser history, proxy logs | `hbFrame.src = baseUrl + '?heartbeat=' + token` — the session token appears in the URL. GAS Apps Script `doGet(e)` logs show it. Browser history records it. Any HTTP proxy or CDN edge log captures it. | NOT ADDRESSED |
| H-6 | **Sign-out sends token in URL parameter** | HIGH | Same as H-5 | `gasApp.src = baseUrl + '?signOut=' + token` — token in URL bar, server logs, proxy logs. | NOT ADDRESSED |
| H-7 | **`unsafe-inline` in CSP script-src** | HIGH | Allows inline script injection | CSP includes `'unsafe-inline'` for `script-src`. If an attacker finds any HTML injection point (even one we think doesn't exist), inline scripts execute. This significantly weakens CSP's XSS protection. | KNOWN — required for inline `<script>` block |

### MEDIUM — Should address before production

| # | Finding | Severity | HIPAA Impact | Attack Vector | Status |
|---|---------|----------|-------------|---------------|--------|
| M-1 | **Tab duplication clones sessionStorage including session token** | MEDIUM | Session leaks to unintended tab | Right-click "Duplicate Tab" creates a second tab with identical `sessionStorage`, including `gas_session_token`. Single-tab enforcement catches this eventually, but there's a race window where both tabs have valid tokens. | PARTIAL — BroadcastChannel catches it, but race window exists |
| M-2 | **Client IP sent to GAS iframe via `postMessage('*')` after auth** | MEDIUM | IP (potential PHI) sent with wildcard origin | `gasFrame.contentWindow.postMessage({type: 'host-client-ip', ip: _clientIp}, '*')` — IP address sent without target origin restriction. | NOT ADDRESSED |
| M-3 | **`window._r` exposes GAS deployment URL globally** | MEDIUM | Information disclosure | `window._r` contains the full GAS deployment URL. Any script (including third-party scripts allowed by CSP) can read this. The deployment URL + deployment ID is sensitive — it's the endpoint for all authenticated operations. | PARTIAL — deleted after use, but race window exists |
| M-4 | **Security event reporter sends details via URL params** | MEDIUM | Sensitive data in URLs | `_reportSecurityEvent` constructs a URL with event details in query parameters, sent via hidden iframe. Attack details end up in server logs in cleartext URL format. | NOT ADDRESSED |
| M-5 | **No session binding to device/browser fingerprint** | MEDIUM | Session token portable across devices | A stolen session token can be used from any browser/device. No binding to user-agent, IP, or any device characteristic. For EMR, this means a stolen token = full access from anywhere. | NOT ADDRESSED |
| M-6 | **Test values hardcoded in production code** | MEDIUM | Drastically weakened timeouts | `SERVER_SESSION_DURATION = 180` (3min instead of 15min), `ABSOLUTE_SESSION_DURATION = 300` (5min instead of 16hr), `HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL = 30000` (30s instead of 5min). Marked with `⚡ TEST VALUE` but still in the deployed code. | ACKNOWLEDGED — test values present |
| M-7 | **`CLIENT_ID` exposed in client-side code** | MEDIUM | OAuth Client ID is public | Google OAuth Client ID is in the HTML source. While Google considers this acceptable for web apps (client IDs are not secrets), it allows an attacker to create a lookalike phishing page using the same client ID to harvest OAuth tokens. Redirect URI validation is the defense, but phishing awareness is reduced. | ACCEPTED RISK (Google's design) |
| M-8 | **No audit trail on client-side authentication events** | MEDIUM | HIPAA §164.312(b) — audit controls | Client-side auth events (sign-in, sign-out, session expiry, tab takeover) are not logged to a persistent audit trail. The `_reportSecurityEvent` function exists but only covers blocked attacks, not routine auth lifecycle events. HIPAA requires logging who accessed what and when. | NOT ADDRESSED |

### LOW — Good to fix, not blocking

| # | Finding | Severity | HIPAA Impact | Attack Vector | Status |
|---|---------|----------|-------------|---------------|--------|
| L-1 | **Maintenance bypass (triple-click wrench)** | LOW | Bypasses maintenance lockout | `sessionStorage.setItem('maint-bypassed', '1')` — anyone who knows the triple-click can bypass maintenance mode. The bypass persists for the tab session. | ACCEPTED — developer convenience feature |
| L-2 | **Sound files cached in localStorage** | LOW | Data persistence beyond session | `cacheSound()` stores audio files in localStorage. Not sensitive data, but localStorage persists after logout. On a shared computer, the next user knows this app was used. | MINOR |
| L-3 | **No Content-Security-Policy `report-uri`/`report-to`** | LOW | No visibility into CSP violations | CSP violations happen silently. No reporting endpoint means you don't know if someone is testing your CSP boundaries. | NOT ADDRESSED |
| L-4 | **Wake Lock requested without user consent indicator** | LOW | Privacy — screen stays on without user awareness | `navigator.wakeLock.request('screen')` is called automatically. For an EMR on a shared device, this could expose PHI on an unattended screen. Auto-lock is a HIPAA physical safeguard. | NOT ADDRESSED |

## Red Team Summary — How I Would Attack This

If I were attacking this system, my priority targets would be:

### Attack 1: Forge messages via DJB2 collision (C-1)
The "HMAC" verification uses a 32-bit non-cryptographic hash. I would:
1. Capture a legitimate signed message (just watch network traffic or page behavior)
2. Brute-force a collision in ~65,536 attempts (takes <1 second)
3. Send forged `gas-heartbeat-ok` messages to keep a session alive indefinitely
4. Or forge `gas-auth-ok` to bypass the server-side session confirmation gate

**Prerequisite:** XSS to inject the brute-force script, OR a compromised GAS deployment (if one of the Google accounts with edit access is phished).

### Attack 2: Intercept the access token (C-2)
The Google access token is sent via `event.source.postMessage({accessToken}, '*')`. I would:
1. Find a way to make the GAS iframe navigate to my origin (redirect chain, DNS rebinding, GAS vulnerability)
2. The parent page still sends the token to `event.source` with `'*'` — my page receives it
3. Use the access token to read the user's Google profile and email

**Difficulty:** High — requires GAS infrastructure compromise or very specific redirect chain.

### Attack 3: Steal session from BroadcastChannel (H-1)
If I achieve XSS on any page of the same origin:
1. Open a `BroadcastChannel('auth-sign-out')`
2. Listen for `tab-claim` messages — receive `{token, email, messageKey}`
3. I now have the session token AND the HMAC key
4. Send forged signed messages to any tab

**Prerequisite:** XSS on any page of the same GitHub Pages origin (not just testauth1.html).

### Attack 4: Phish via shared GitHub Pages origin
GitHub Pages shares `*.github.io` as a common origin domain. If I create `attacker.github.io`, I can potentially:
1. Use the exposed `CLIENT_ID` to create a convincing Google Sign-In page
2. Embed the legitimate page in my page
3. Since `frame-src` allows `script.google.com`, I can't directly iframe their page, but I can create a lookalike

**Note:** This is mitigated by GitHub Pages' subdomain isolation — each repo gets its own origin (`org.github.io/repo`). Cross-repo XSS isn't possible via GitHub Pages subdomain isolation.

## Blue Team Summary — What's Working Well

Credit where it's due. The current implementation gets a lot right:

| Defense | Implementation | Effectiveness |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| **Auth wall defers to server-side confirmation** | `_pendingSessionShow` waits for `gas-auth-ok` before hiding auth wall | Excellent — prevents forged `gas-session-created` from exposing the app |
| **First-write-wins on messageKey** | Only accepts first `gas-session-created` with a key | Good — prevents key overwrite attacks (weakened by multiple nullification points) |
| **30-second replay window** | `gas-session-created` rejected if >30s after iframe load | Good — limits replay attack window |
| **Message type allowlist** | Only known message types are processed | Good — reduces attack surface |
| **Security event reporting** | Blocked attacks are reported to GAS backend with rate limiting | Good — provides audit trail for attacks |
| **DOM clearing on session expiry** | `gasFrame.src = 'about:blank'` destroys PHI from DOM | Excellent for HIPAA — goes beyond overlay-only protection |
| **sessionStorage over localStorage** | Session data cleared on tab close | Good for HIPAA — no persistence |
| **Referrer policy `no-referrer`** | Prevents token leakage via Referer header | Good |
| **Cross-device session enforcement** | Server detects new sign-in, evicts old session | Excellent — single-session-per-user model |
| **Single-tab enforcement** | BroadcastChannel coordinates active tab | Good — limits exposure surface |
| **IP format validation** | `_validateIp()` prevents log injection | Good — defense in depth |
| **CSP with restrictive directives** | `default-src 'none'`, restricted sources | Good foundation (weakened by `unsafe-inline`) |

## HIPAA 2026 Readiness Assessment

The 2025 HIPAA Security Rule NPRM (expected final May 2026) eliminates "addressable" safeguards — everything becomes mandatory.

| HIPAA Requirement | Status | Gap |
|-------------------|--------|-----|
| **MFA for all ePHI access** (§164.312(d)) | NOT MET | Google SSO is single-factor. Need device-based second factor or TOTP. |
| **Encryption at rest** (§164.312(a)(2)(iv)) | NOT MET | sessionStorage is not encrypted at rest. Browser may write to disk. |
| **Audit controls** (§164.312(b)) | PARTIAL | Security events logged, but auth lifecycle events (login/logout/timeout) not in persistent audit trail. |
| **Integrity controls** (§164.312(e)(1)) | NOT MET | DJB2 hash is not a recognized integrity mechanism. Need HMAC-SHA256 minimum. |
| **Automatic logoff** (§164.312(a)(2)(iii)) | MET | Session timeout + absolute timeout + server-side enforcement. |
| **Authentication** (§164.312(d)) | PARTIAL | Google OAuth provides strong identity verification, but no MFA and no session binding. |
| **Transmission security** (§164.312(e)(1)) | MOSTLY MET | HTTPS enforced via CSP `upgrade-insecure-requests`. Token-in-URL (H-5, H-6) weakens this. |
| **PHI third-party disclosure** | NOT MET | api.ipify.org receives IP (PHI) without BAA. |
| **Penetration testing** (new annual requirement) | IN PROGRESS | Offensive security tests exist. Need formal annual cadence. |
| **Network segmentation** (new requirement) | N/A | Client-side web app — server-side segmentation is GAS infrastructure. |

---

## Priority Remediation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Critical (Before any PHI)
1. **Replace DJB2 with HMAC-SHA256** — Use Web Crypto API (`crypto.subtle.importKey` + `crypto.subtle.sign`) for proper cryptographic message signing. The GAS side computes HMAC-SHA256 and sends the signature; the HTML side verifies it. This is the single highest-impact fix.
2. **Remove api.ipify.org dependency** — Move IP lookup server-side (GAS can get client IP from the request). If client-side is required, self-host an IP echo endpoint behind your own domain with a BAA.
3. **Implement MFA** — Add TOTP or WebAuthn as a second factor after Google SSO. Google's Advanced Protection Program is an option for Google Workspace accounts.
4. **Move session token out of URLs** — Use `postMessage` for heartbeat and sign-out instead of iframe URL parameters. The token-in-URL pattern (H-5, H-6) is a known anti-pattern per OWASP.

### Phase 2: High (Before production deployment)
5. **Add origin validation to postMessage listener** — Check `event.origin` against expected GAS origins before processing messages.
6. **Stop broadcasting credentials on BroadcastChannel** — Broadcast events ("session-changed"), not tokens. Each tab reads its own sessionStorage independently.
7. **Add CSP `report-to` directive** — Set up a reporting endpoint to detect CSP probing.
8. **Replace `'*'` targetOrigin** — Use specific origin where possible. Document and mitigate where `'*'` is architecturally required.

### Phase 3: Medium (Before EMR production)
9. **Session binding** — Bind session to user-agent + IP hash. Reject heartbeats from mismatched fingerprints.
10. **Auth lifecycle audit logging** — Log every auth event (sign-in, sign-out, timeout, re-auth, tab takeover) to the GAS backend.
11. **Remove test values** — Establish a build process or environment variable system to prevent test timeouts from reaching production.
12. **Wake Lock consent** — Add a visible indicator when screen lock is being prevented, or make it configurable.
