# XSS Explainer — Why It Keeps Coming Up in Security Tests

This document explains Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the context of our security testing: what it is, why our tests mention it constantly, what Playwright's "god mode" means, and whether XSS would be catastrophic if it happened.

---

## What Is XSS?

**Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** is when an attacker gets their own JavaScript code to run inside your web page — not on their own site, but on *yours*, in a real user's browser.

Why does this matter? Because JavaScript running on your page has access to everything on that page: it can read the DOM, modify variables, intercept function calls, read cookies, and talk to your backend as if it were the legitimate page code. It's the difference between a stranger standing outside your house looking in (harmless) and a stranger sitting at your desk using your computer (very bad).

### How XSS normally happens

XSS requires an **injection point** — a place where user-controlled input gets inserted into the page's HTML or JavaScript without sanitization. Common examples:

- A search box that displays "You searched for: [user input]" — if the input is `<script>alert(1)</script>` and it's inserted raw into the HTML, the script executes
- A URL parameter like `?name=<script>...` that gets rendered on the page
- A comment field that stores and displays HTML without escaping it
- An error message that echoes back the malicious input

### Why XSS doesn't apply to testauthgas1

Our page has **no injection points**:

- No search boxes, comment fields, or user input forms that render content back into the DOM
- No URL parameters that get inserted into the HTML
- No `innerHTML` calls with user-controlled data
- All data flows are programmatic (JavaScript variables passed to functions), not DOM-rendered

Without an injection point, an attacker has no way to get their JavaScript onto our page. They can write all the malicious scripts they want — they just have no delivery mechanism to make them execute in a user's browser on our domain.

## Why Do Security Tests Keep Mentioning XSS?

When test results say things like "PATCHABLE — requires XSS" or "INTERCEPTABLE — requires XSS as a prerequisite," they're answering two questions at once:

**Question 1: "Can this thing be exploited?"**
Yes — technically. JavaScript has no code integrity protection. Any function, variable, or object in the page's scope can be read, modified, or replaced by other JavaScript running on the same page. This is a fundamental property of the language, not a bug.

**Question 2: "Can a real attacker actually do this?"**
No — because to exploit it, the attacker needs to run JavaScript on our page first. And to run JavaScript on our page, they need XSS. And to get XSS, they need an injection point. And we don't have one.

The tests mention XSS to be **precise about the threat model**. Instead of just saying "SAFE" (which would be misleading — the vulnerability technically exists) or "VULNERABLE" (which would be misleading — no one can actually exploit it), they say "exists but requires XSS" — which tells you exactly what would need to go wrong for this to become a real problem.

Think of it like reporting that your safe's combination dial is accessible: true, someone could try combinations, but first they'd need to break through the locked front door, the alarm system, and the guard dog. The dial being accessible isn't the real risk — the front door is.

## Is XSS a Catastrophic Breach?

**Your instinct is largely correct** — if an attacker achieves XSS on our page, the situation is very serious. Here's what they could do:

### What XSS enables (the bad news)
- **Read the DOM** — see whatever the authenticated user sees on the page
- **Override functions** — replace `handleTokenResponse`, `_verifyMessageSignature`, or any other function
- **Intercept tokens** — capture the Google OAuth credential as it passes through `handleTokenResponse`
- **Modify the message allowlist** — add custom message types to `_KNOWN_GAS_MESSAGES`
- **Spoof the UI** — show fake content, hide real content, display fake login forms
- **Exfiltrate data** — send captured data to an attacker-controlled server (limited by CSP's `connect-src`, but `img-src` could be used if it were permissive)

### What XSS still can't do (the defense-in-depth payoff)
- **Forge server-side sessions** — the HMAC secret lives in GAS Script Properties, not in the browser. XSS can't fabricate valid session tokens
- **Bypass Google OAuth** — even with a captured ID token, the attacker can't replay it from a different origin (audience/nonce validation)
- **Access CacheService** — server-side session storage is completely inaccessible from client JavaScript
- **Read other users' data** — XSS affects one user's browser session, not the server or other users
- **Persist across sessions** — once the user closes the tab, the XSS is gone (we use sessionStorage, not localStorage)

### The verdict

XSS on our page would be **serious but not catastrophic**. The attacker could see what the current user sees and potentially act as that user for the duration of their session. But they can't compromise the server, access other users, forge sessions, or establish persistence. This is exactly what defense-in-depth is designed for — even when the outer wall (CSP/no injection points) fails, the inner walls (server-side validation, HMAC tokens, Google OAuth) still hold.

The reason we invest so heavily in preventing XSS (CSP, no injection points, input sanitization) is that it's the **single prerequisite** for nearly every client-side attack. Block XSS and you block all of them simultaneously. That's why it keeps coming up — it's the keystone.

## Playwright "God Mode" — Why Tests Work But Real Attackers Can't

### What Playwright is

Playwright is a browser automation tool. It launches a real browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.) and controls it programmatically — clicking buttons, filling forms, navigating pages, and critically: **executing arbitrary JavaScript on any page**.

### What "god mode" means

When our tests call `page.evaluate("""...""")`, Playwright injects that JavaScript directly into the page's execution context via the browser's **DevTools Protocol** (CDP). This is the same mechanism that Chrome DevTools uses when you open the Console tab and type JavaScript.

This means Playwright can:
- Access and modify any JavaScript variable (`_clientIp`, `_messageKey`, `_KNOWN_GAS_MESSAGES`)
- Override any function (`handleTokenResponse`, `_verifyMessageSignature`)
- Create DOM elements (fake iframes, invisible forms)
- Send postMessages with any payload
- Basically do anything that JavaScript on the page could do

**This is not XSS.** Playwright isn't exploiting a vulnerability to inject code — it's using a privileged debugging interface that has direct access to the browser's internals.

### Why a real attacker can't do this

A real attacker on the internet has **none** of these capabilities:

| Capability | Playwright (testing) | Real attacker | Why the difference |
|-----------|---------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Execute JS on your page | Yes (DevTools Protocol) | No | Attacker doesn't control the user's browser |
| Read your page's variables | Yes | No | Cross-origin policy blocks access |
| Override your functions | Yes | No | Requires same-origin JS execution |
| Send postMessages | Yes (from same context) | Yes (from their own page) | But messages are signature-verified |
| Modify the DOM | Yes | No | Requires same-origin access |

The attacker can open their *own* browser and visit your page. They can even open DevTools on *their* browser. But they can't open DevTools on *someone else's* browser. That's the fundamental gap.

**The only way to bridge this gap is XSS** — tricking the user's browser into running attacker code as if it were part of your page. And as explained above, our page has no injection points for that.

### So why do we run these tests?

The tests simulate the **worst case** — what happens if an attacker somehow achieves code execution on the page? They test our defense-in-depth layers:

1. **If an attacker hides the auth wall** (Attack 1) → does the server still protect data? **Yes.**
2. **If an attacker forges a session message** (Attack 2) → does the server accept it? **No.**
3. **If an attacker patches security functions** (Attack 4) → does anything actually break? **No — server-side validation is independent.**
4. **If an attacker intercepts the OAuth token** (Attack 6) → can they replay it? **No — nonce + audience validation.**

The tests prove that even with god-mode access, an attacker can't breach the server-side security. The client-side is a convenience layer, not a security boundary. The server trusts nothing from the client — it validates everything independently.

### The analogy

Running Playwright tests is like hiring a locksmith to test your home security by giving them a copy of every key. They'll tell you "I was able to open every door" — but that doesn't mean a burglar can. The burglar doesn't have the keys. The test's value is in showing what's behind each door and whether anything truly sensitive is accessible even with full access — not in proving that the doors can be opened with keys.

## Summary

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| What is XSS? | Attacker gets their JavaScript to run on your page in a user's browser |
| Why does it keep coming up? | It's the prerequisite for nearly every client-side attack — block it and you block them all |
| Can an attacker get XSS on our page? | No — there are no injection points (no user input rendered in DOM) |
| Is XSS catastrophic if it happens? | Serious but not catastrophic — attacker can see/act as one user for one session, but can't forge server sessions, access other users, or persist |
| What is Playwright god mode? | Direct browser control via DevTools Protocol — not a vulnerability, a testing tool |
| Can a real attacker use Playwright on our site? | No — they'd need physical access to the user's browser or XSS to achieve equivalent access |
| Why run these tests then? | To verify that defense-in-depth holds even in the worst case — that server-side validation catches everything the client-side misses |
